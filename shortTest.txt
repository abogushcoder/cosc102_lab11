Oh sweet pea come on and dance with me.
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me.
Oh sweet pea won't you be my girl.
Won't you, won't you, won't you be my girl.
I went to a dance just the other night.
I saw a girl there she was out of sight.
I asked a friend of mine who she could be.
He said that her friends just call her sweet pea.
Oh sweet pea come on and dance with me.
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me.
Oh sweet pea won't you be my girl.
Won't you, won't you, won't you be my girl.
I walked on over and asked her to dance.
Thinkin' maybe later we would make a romance.
But every guy there was thinkin' like me.
I had to stand in line to get a dance with sweet pea.
Oh sweet pea come on and dance with me.
Come on, come on, come on and dance with me.
Oh sweet pea won't you be my girl.
Won't you, won't you, won't you be my girl.
I finally got to whisper sweet words in her ear.
Suggest her that we outta get away from there.
We took a little walk I held he close to me.
And underneath the stars I said to sweet pea.
Oh sweet pea I love you can't you see.
Love you, love you, love you can't you see.
Oh sweet pea won't you be my girl.
